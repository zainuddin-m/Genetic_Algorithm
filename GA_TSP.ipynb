Genetic Algorithms\n","# Task 3.1 The Travelling Salesman Problem\n","## Problem Description:\n","How to design a genetic algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem:\n","1. Encoding Scheme:\n","Each solution (or route) is represented as a list of integers where each integer corresponds to a city. For example: [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 16] represents the order in which the cities are visited.\n","2. Fitness Function:\n","The fitness function calculates the total distance of the route.\n","Add up the distances between consecutive cities in the route.\n","3. Genetic Operators:\n","- Selection: Use tournament selection where the best of 3 randomly selected routes is chosen for reproduction.\n","- Crossover: Partially Matched Crossover (PMX):Split the route into two parts. Combine the first part of one parent with the remaining part of the second parent, ensuring no duplicates.\n","- Mutation: Randomly swap the positions of two cities in the route to maintain diversity."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WqEKkFWlzz9s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733842293929,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":440,"user":{"displayName":"Zain","userId":"13454396303356700271"}}},"source":["TourSize
